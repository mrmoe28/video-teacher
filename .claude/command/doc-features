## üîÑ Processing Pipeline

### Video Processing Flow

1. **Input**: YouTube URL submitted
2. **Crawling**: Extract metadata using ytdl-core
3. **Transcription**:
   - Try YouTube auto-captions first
   - Fallback to Whisper AI if needed
4. **AI Analysis**: OpenAI processes transcript for educational content
5. **Content Generation**: Create decks, slides, steps, and quizzes
6. **Ready**: Materials available for interactive learning

### Job Status Tracking
- Real-time progress updates
- Error handling and recovery
- Retry mechanisms for failed processes
